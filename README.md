# fileupload-metadata


Located at https://fileupmeta.herokuapp.com

Simple site to upload a file and see its size in bytes.

Created using Node.js, Express, and Pug.

The multer package was used to handle the upload.
Pug was used to create a very simple HTML page. It was fun learning Pug's syntax. Its pretty different but also very clean visually. Will have
to find time and projects to use it on.
